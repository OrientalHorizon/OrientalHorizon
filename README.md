- 👋 Hi, I’m @OrientalHorizon or Ma Yifei.
- 👀 I’m interested in nothing. 破防中，不知道自己能干啥。不学无术，每天开摆。
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multivariable calculus (in an analytical view), algorithms, data structures, and university physics.
- 📚 My favorite course is modern Chinese history taught by [Dr. Ma Nan](https://ma.sjtu.edu.cn/info/1196/3365.htm?id=323).
- 📫 How to reach me: email to shenjidf11@sjtu.edu.cn or via QQ: 1690670398.
- 🎸 My favourite band is [Hedgehog](http://ciweiyuedui.com/).
- 🚆 I am proud to be a rail fan. Maybe I will switch to transportation studies?
